# Setup

In the orginal setup, the server is run from a Raspberry Pi, while development takes place on a laptop. They have slightly different needs for their environment setup and so are addressed separately here.

Once it is set up and running, graphs will begin to generate on the Visualise page:

## Environment setup on Mac/Linux computer
### Pyenv
Use `pyenv` to change the python version for the project directory.* 
```
pyenv install 3.11.10
pyenv local 3.11
```
_\* Python 3.11 in this case to match the Raspberry Pi that will host the server for continuous data logging_

Ensure the following is in your `~/.zshrc`:
```
export PATH="/Users/username/.pyenv:$PATH"
eval "$(pyenv init -)"
```

### Poetry
To set up `poetry` environment:
```
poetry shell
poetry install
```

After this point, continue to [SQLite Database](#sqlite-database).

## Environment setup on Raspberry Pi
Raspberry Pi model 1B: Raspbian GNU/Linux 12 (bookworm)

### Dependencies
`Pillow` requires `zlib` and `libjpeg`. Install with:
```
sudo apt install libjpeg-dev zlib1g-dev
```

This project requires `numpy` to be installed with apt. See the section [Known issues with numpy](#known-issues-with-numpy) for more detail. 
```sh
sudo apt install python3-numpy
```

### Venv
`venv` is used instead of `poetry` on the Raspberry Pi. It is lighter weight and works well to lock down the version of `numpy` due to the problems listed below. 
A `requirements.txt` is generated with `poetry` from a Mac/Linux computer and then used by `venv` on the Raspberry Pi. See the [Development section](#to-update-the-environment) for more details on generating the `requirements.txt.`


`ssh` into the Raspberry Pi, and from the `weather-station` directory, run the following:
```sh
python -m venv --system-site-packages .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --prefer-binary -r requirements.txt 
```
*Note: `--prefer-binary` directs `pip` to use piwheels versions of packages if they are available. This saves time on compilation.* 

After this point, continue to [SQLite Database](#sqlite-database).


### Known issues with numpy
Some issues may be encountered with `numpy` throwing a `ChefInstallError` when running `poetry install` on a Raspberry Pi. 
If `numpy` appears to install correctly, it can be tested by opening Python and trying to import `numpy`. If it mentions the following error and fails to import then a system installation of `numpy` must be used: 
```
libf77blas.so.3: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
``` 

The solution is to make `numpy` available globally rather than installing it with `pip` in the `venv`.  
```sh
pip3 uninstall numpy  # remove previously installed version
sudo apt install python3-numpy
```
See https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/troubleshooting-importerror.html#raspberry-pi



## SQLite Database
From the `src` directory, initialise the SQLite database with:
```
flask --app server init-db
```
The database will appear in the `instance` directory as `weather.sqlite`

## Raspberry Pi Pico W + Kitronik Air Quality Board
* Copy scripts from ```rp2``` onto Raspberry Pi Pico. 
* Change constants at the top of the copy of ```main.py``` on the Pico:
```
SERVER_URL = 'localhost'+'/data'
WIFI_NAME = 'Wifi_name'
WIFI_PASSWORD = 'Wifi_password'
```

From this point see [Development Server](#development-server) or [Deploying to Production](#deploying-to-production) as required. 

## Development Server
* To run the server go to the ```src``` directory and execute:
```
flask --app server run --debug --host=0.0.0.0
```
If running the development server from the Raspberry Pi, remove the `--debug` option


## Deploying to Production
These instructions are written for a server that is run from a Raspberry Pi. 

### WSGI Server
Start [Gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org/) WSGI server from `src` directory using:
```sh
gunicorn -c server/gunicorn_config.py server:gunicorn_app
```

Set up the config `server/gunicorn_config.py`:
```sh
bind="127.0.0.1:8000"
workers=2
```

### HTTP Server
Install the [nginx](https://nginx.org/) HTTP server:
```sh
sudo apt-get install nginx
```

Set up a symbolic link to the ![nginx config](../src/server/nginx/weather-station.config) at `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/weather-station.config`:
```
cd /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
sudo ln -s /home/{username}/Code/weather-station/src/server/nginx/weather-station.config .
```
`Nginx` can be started with:
```sh
sudo systemctl start nginx
```
Changes made in the configuration file will not be applied until the command to reload configuration is sent to nginx or it is restarted. To reload configuration, execute:
```sh
sudo nginx -s reload
```

### Systemd: set up server to automatically run on startup
The last step is to automatically run the server on startup. 
This is done with the[`systemd`](https://systemd.io/) system and service manager, which is used by Raspberry Pi.   

For  Gunicorn we will need a new service that `systemd` can run. 
(Nginx has already created its own service on installation.)

Create a new file `weather-station.service` for `systemd` in the folder `/usr/lib/systemd/system`:

```sh
[Unit]
Description=Weather Station
After=multi-user.target

[Service]
WorkingDirectory=/home/{username}/Code/weather-station/src
ExecStart=/home/{username}/Code/weather-station/.venv/bin/gunicorn -c server/gunicorn_config.py server:gunicorn_app &

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
*\*Gunicorn is started with `&` so that it runs in the background.*

Finally, both Gunicorn and nginx must be started and enabled so that they can run automatically at startup of the Raspberry Pi:

```sh
sudo systemctl start nginx
sudo systemctl enable nginx

sudo systemctl start weather-station
sudo systemctl enable weather-station
```

(If needed the services can be stopped with `sudo systemctl stop {service}`.)


Setup is now complete!


# Development

## To update the environment:
1. Update the `pyproject.toml` as required 
2. Run `poetry install` to install new packages 
3. Run `poetry lock` to update lock file 
4. From within the `weather-station` dir, generate a `requirements.txt`:
```sh
poetry export --without-hashes --format=requirements.txt > requirements.txt
``` 
5. Copy over to the Raspberry Pi (via `scp` or `git`) and install using:
```sh
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --prefer-binary -r requirements.txt 
```

## Development of Pico scripts
* The ```rp2``` directory mirrors the scripts that will go onto the Raspberry Pi Pico.
