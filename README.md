# Development

* To run the server go to the ```src``` directory and type:
```
flask --app server run --debug --host=0.0.0.0
```

* The ```rp2``` directory mirrors the scripts that will go onto the Raspberry Pi Pico. 

# Set up

## Poetry
To set up poetry environment:
```
poetry init
poetry shell
poetry install
```

## SQLite Database
Initialise the SQLite database with:
```
flask --app flaskr init-db
```
The database will appear in the `instance` directory as `weather.sqlite`

## Raspberry Pi Pico W + Kitronik Air Quality Board
* Copy scripts from ```rp2``` onto Raspberry Pi. 
* Change constants at the top of the copy of ```send_data.py``` on the Pico:
```
SERVER_URL = 'localhost'+'/data'
WIFI_NAME = 'Wifi_name'
WIFI_PASSWORD = 'Wifi_password'
```
